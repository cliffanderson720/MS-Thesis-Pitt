abstract = {Abstract This paper analyses a continuum model of the sedimentation of polydisperse suspensions, where the volume concentrations of the solids species are the sought unknowns. This leads to systems of conservation laws which are non-genuinely nonlinear (“non-convex”) in the sense that they are only piecewise genuinely nonlinear. The solution of a Riemann problem is represented as a concatenation of elementary waves, where the linear degeneracy requires using the Liu entropy condition. After a general description of the composition of elementary waves, an algorithm for the computational construction is given. The solution of the Riemann problem is then utilized as a problem-adapted building block of a front tracking method. For the model of bidisperse suspensions, Riemann problems are classified by the location of the left and right state in the phase space of unknown variables. The front tracking method is applied to solve the initial value problem of a first-order hyperbolic 2 × 2 system of conservation laws describing the settling of a bidisperse suspension. The solution obtained by front tracking is compared with results obtained by an experiment and a finite difference scheme.},,

  abstract = {Our understanding of information carried by waves propagating in cardiovascular systems has rapidly advanced in recent years due to usage of modeling and simulations. The present research aims at developing a high-resolution numerical scheme that can be applied to solve mutually interactive one-dimensional (1-D) flows that prevail in tree-like arterial networks. A scheme using finite-volume, Roe-splitting flux-difference method in conjunction with a time-accurate Runge–Kutta marching method was developed. The theory of characteristics was adopted for the treatment of boundary conditions, resulting in a unified formulism using a newly defined reflection coefficient as a measure to quantify the wave reflection occurring at the interior and terminal nodes of the tree-like vascular structure. The derived boundary condition formulas are convenient for dealing with various types of boundary specification requirements that may arise in vascular hemodynamics. There are two computational models, an isolated tubular conduit and a tree-like structure model, that were employed for the present scheme validation and wave simulation demonstration. The objective was to assess the accuracy of the present scheme in capturing long-duration, complex, and tiny wave reflections and re-reflections. The superiority of the present scheme on capturing discontinuous jumps was first demonstrated in the isolated conduit simulation by comparing the results against exact solutions as well as those obtained by Lax–Wendroff method. To evaluate and validate the time-accuracy of the present scheme in treating multiple wave reflections and re-reflections in tree-like structures, a linear wave-tracking algorithm was employed. Compared to the Lax–Wendroff finite-difference method, the present flux-difference Roe-splitting scheme was shown to be more robust and accurate, which offers high-resolution with minimal dissipation and dispersion errors in simulating long-duration, mutually interacting wave reflections and re-reflections that commonly occur in the tree-like arterial network.},

  abstract = {Previous studies on physical boundary conditions for flame–boundary interactions of an ideal, multicomponent, compressible gas have neglected reactive source terms in their boundary condition treatments. By combining analyses of incompletely parabolic systems with those based on the hyperbolic Euler equations, a rational set of boundary conditions is determined to address this shortcoming. Accompanying these conditions is a procedure for implementation into a multidimensional code. In the limits of zero reaction rate or one species, the boundary conditions reduce in a predictable way to cases found in the literature. Application is made to premixed and nonpremixed flames in one and two dimensions to establish efficacy. Inclusion of source terms in boundary conditions derived from characteristic analysis is essential to avoid unphysical generation of pressure and velocity gradients as well as flow reversals. Minor deficiencies in the boundary conditions are attributed primarily to the diffusive terms. Imposing vanishing diffusive boundary-normal flux gradients works better than imposing vanishing fluxes but neither is entirely satisfactory.},

  abstract = { Polydisperse suspensions with particles of a finite number N of size classes have been widely studied in laboratory experiments. However, in most real-world applications the particle sizes are distributed continuously. In this paper, a well-studied one-dimensional kinematic model for batch sedimentation of polydisperse suspensions of small equal-density spheres is extended to suspensions with a continuous particle size distribution. For this purpose, the phase density function Φ = Φ(t, x, ξ), where ξ ∈ [0, 1] is the normalized squared size of the particles, is introduced, whose integral with respect to ξ on an interval [ξ1, ξ2] is equivalent to the volume fraction at (t, x) occupied by particles of that size range. Combining the Masliyah–Lockett–Bassoon (MLB) model for the solid-fluid relative velocity for each solids species with the concept of phase density function yields a scalar, first-order equation for Φ, namely the equation of the generalized kinetic theory. Three numerical schemes for the solution of this equation are introduced, and a numerical example and an L1 error study show that one of these schemes introduces less numerical diffusion and less spurious oscillations near discontinuities than the others. Several numerical examples illustrate the simulated behavior of this kind of suspensions. Numerical results also illustrate the solution of an eigenvalue problem associated with the equation of the generalized kinetic theory. },

  abstract = {Multiphase flows of suspensions and emulsions are frequently approximated by spatially one-dimensional kinematic models, in which the velocity of each species of the disperse phase is an explicitly given function of the vector of concentrations of all species. The continuity equations for all species then form a system of conservation laws which describes spatial segregation and the creation of areas of different composition. This class of models also includes multi-class traffic flow, where vehicles belong to different classes according to their preferential velocities. Recently, these models were extended to fluxes that depend discontinuously on the spatial coordinate, which appear in clarifier--thickener models, in duct flows with abruptly varying cross-sectional area, and in traffic flow with variable road surface conditions. This paper presents a new family of numerical schemes for such kinematic flows with a discontinuous flux. It is shown how a very simple scheme for the scalar case, which is adapted to the ``concentration times velocity'' structure of the flux, can be extended to kinematic models with phase velocities that change sign, flows with two or more species (the system case), and discontinuous fluxes. In addition, a MUSCL-type upgrade in combination with a Runge--Kutta-type time discretization can be devised to attain second-order accuracy. It is proved that two particular schemes within the family, which apply to systems of conservation laws, preserve an invariant region of admissible concentration vectors, provided that all velocities have the same sign. Moreover, for the relevant case of a multiplicative flux discontinuity and a constant maximum density, it is proved that one scalar version converges to a BVtentropy solution of the model. In the latter case, the compactness proof involves a novel uniform but local estimate of the spatial total variation of the approximate solutions. Numerical examples illustrate the performance of all variants within the new family of schemes, including applications to problems of sedimentation, traffic flow, and the settling of oil-in-water emulsions.},

Despite the availability of analytical methods, the difficulty in obtaining high-quality and standardized microsamples at the point of collection remains a major limitation of the process. Here, we detail and model a blood separation principle which exploits discrete viscosity differences caused by blood particle sedimentation in a laminar flow. Based on this phenomenon, we developed a portable capillary-driven microfluidic device that separates blood microsamples collected from finger-pricks and delivers 2 µL of metered serum for bench-top analysis. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated the high purity of generated microsamples. Proteomic and metabolomic analyses of the microsamples of 283 proteins and 1351 metabolite features was consistent with samples generated via a conventional centrifugation method. These results were confirmed by a clinical study scrutinising 8 blood markers in obese patients.},

  abstract = {Polydisperse suspensions consist of particles differing in size or density that are dispersed in a viscous fluid. During sedimentation, the different particle species segregate and create areas of different composition. Spatially one-dimensional mathematical models of this process can be expressed as strongly coupled, nonlinear systems of first-order conservation laws. The solution of this system is the vector of volume fractions of each species as a function of depth and time, which will in general be discontinuous. It is well known that this system is strictly hyperbolic provided that the Masliyah–Lockett–Bassoon (MLB) flux vector is chosen, the particles have the same density, and the hindered-settling factor (a multiplicative algebraic expression appearing in the flux vector) does not depend on the particle size but is the same for all species. It is the purpose of this paper to prove that this hyperbolicity result remains valid in a fairly general class of cases where the hindered-settling factor does depend on particle size. This includes the common power-law type hindered-settling factor in which the exponent, sometimes called Richardson–Zaki exponent, is determined individually for each species, and is a decreasing function of particle size. The importance of this paper is two-fold: it proves stability for a class of polydisperse suspensions that was not covered in previous work, and it offers a new analysis of real data.},

Solutions to this problem are in general discontinuous and exhibit kinematic shocks that separate areas of different composition. The solution requires the construction of so-called elementary curves in phase space, which are determined from eigenvector fields of the Jacobian of the flux function. Differences in solution behavior to the previously analyzed equal-density case are due to an umbilic point, which appears for different densities only. The initial value problem is eventually solved by the front tracking method, which generates a series of Riemann problems. It turns out that the solution of the problem predicts a fairly complex process of sediment formation, and that the stationary solution can consist of non-constant smooth transitions. This observation is of interest for manufacturing of functionally graded materials.},

For the “genuinely nonlinear” 2 × 2 conservation laws, Conley and Smoller [Comm. Pure Appl. Math.23 (1970), 867–884] proved that a shock satisfies Lax's shock inequalities [cf. Comm. Pure Appl. Math.14 (1957), 537–566] if and only if it is admissible. In this paper, we consider systems that are not necessarily genuinely nonlinear.},
